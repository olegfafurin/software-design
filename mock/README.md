### VK API search component

Usage: see [`Demo.kt`](https://github.com/olegfafurin/software-design/tree/master/mock/src/main/kotlin/org/imd/sd/mock/Demo.kt)

Add system environment variable `VK_API_SERVICE_KEY` before launch.

##### Notice

Your local `SearchResponseParserTest` won't pass because `sample_output.txt` is excluded from git tree
